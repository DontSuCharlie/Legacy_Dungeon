16 Flood: Floods the entire level with water. Certain skills (such as Freeze, Electricity, Fire -> Steam) will result in more powerful moves. Movement is slowed as well unless one has the Float crystal.
17 Electrocution: Sends a wave of electricity. If water is around, it will follow the path.
18 Flash Freeze: Covers the whole room in a blizzard, temporarily lowering vision while doing some damage. If done on a water zone, enemy(s) will be frozen as well.

21: Stun Spore: Throws a bag of spores that temporarily confuses/stuns the enemy. Covers a significant amount of range.
22: Shadow Swipe: Pushes and stuns your opponent. While your opponent is stunned, try smashing your buttons as quickly as possible to strike LOTS of times.
