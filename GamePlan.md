IV. Daily Log
-------------------
4/12: Charlie created the basic frame. The game officially exists.
4/12: Charlie decided to get distracted and instead of actually making the game work, decided to make it so that the window now has its own custom icon.
4/12: (technically 4/13 now because past midnight) Charlie continues to delve on useless functions - like making the window pop up in the MIDDLE of the user's screen. ANY user's screen.
4/19: Anish is writing in third person.

/*
//Needs to construct Window with JFrame
//Needs to paint the Window constantly
//Needs to take keyboard/mouse input and do something with it
//Collision check should be in a separate file
//music/Sound should be in a different file
//AI should be in a a different file
//Random map generation should be in a different file
//Character stats/skills should also be in a different file
//While in the dungeon, the World Map can be updated (use a thread!!! huuehuuehuue) 
//What the hell are threads??????? - uses the Runnable Interface
//Threads allow for parallel processing - in which multiple methods run at the same time
//We need something that allows the program to shutdown safely
//How do you make it multi-platform? What safety things (prevent crashing, allows for different OS's, etc.) are behind a video game?
//How do games install? wtf??!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?
//We also need to include Java DL files for people without JAVA to guarantee that the game will run
//Also needs safe file (save will be in a different file)
//package LegacyDungeon;//a package ensures that upon mixing it with other people's codes, names won't confuse the compiler
*/

//Why do we need to import java.awt.event when java.awt.* already imports everything after that????
//I think it's because .* does not include other files (it only includes stuff directly in the file, but not subfolders)
