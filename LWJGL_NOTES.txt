LWJGL Notes

//What LWJGL is//
JAR is basically a .zip folder for Java classes. It acts as a library where we can use LWJGL's pre-defined methods and classes.

There are 4 JAR files in the game currently

lwjgl.jar = core of LWJGL
jinput.jar = joystick and other similar stuff's functionality
AppleJavaExtensions.jar = allows LWJGL to work on Macs (if the game is not created on a Mac)
slick-util.jar = efficient sound and image loader that is designed to work with LWJGL
