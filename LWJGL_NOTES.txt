LWJGL Notes

//What LWJGL is//
JAR is basically a .zip folder for Java classes. It acts as a library where we can use LWJGL's pre-defined methods and classes.

There are 4 JAR files in the game currently
http://lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=General_FAQ#How_can_I_load_images_and_sounds_with_LWJGL.3F

lwjgl.jar = core of LWJGL
jinput.jar = joystick and other similar stuff's functionality
AppleJavaExtensions.jar = allows LWJGL to work on Macs (if the game is not created on a Mac)
slick-util.jar = efficient sound and image loader that is designed to work with LWJGL

//"Setting up" LWJGL without IDE//
It's simply actually. Every time you want to compile your .java file, add the following command in between javac and your file name:
javac -cp .;<insert JAR file and their directories here> fileToBeCompiled.java

NOTE: SPACES ARE IMPORTANT. If you're changing the classpath of multiple files, do not add spaces.

FOR EXAMPLE, if your JAR file is located in C:/Desktop/Github/LegacyDungeon/Jar/lwjgl.jar

javac -cp .;C:/Desktop/Github/LegacyDungeon/Jar/lwjgl.jar fileToBeCompiled.java

IF your JAR file is located in a file subdirectory under your to-be-compiled file then just add onto the current subdirectory.

FOR EXAMPLE, you're currently in C:/Desktop/Github/LegacyDungeon
then

javac -cp .;Jar/lwjgl.jar fileToBeCompiled.java

IF you have multiple, then just add a semi-colon (if you're in Windows, apparently other OS's have their own divider)

javac -cp .;Jar/lwjgl.jar;Jar/otherJar.jar

Every time you run it, you have to include -Djava.library.path=<directoryToYourNatives>. Unlike -cp, you do not need to type in all the .dll files. Simply change the directory until you get to the folder with all your native files.

Example: java -cp .;Jar/lwjgl.jar;Jar/otherJar.jar -Djava.library.path=native/windows fileThatWasCompiled
